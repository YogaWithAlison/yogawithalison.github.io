                 <p>In the life we are living today, things are going fast, too fast. Yoga really helps you to step back and allow you to breath, to see the world at slow pace, allow the mind to let go and create a balance beween the body and the mind.
I also consider it important to take care of your health in general, with the food you eat, the amount of sleep you get etc..., but also with treating yourself for a nice body treatment.
So this is why, I am offering massages to help you unwind the stress from your body and taking care of yourself in a different way. And most importantly, in the comfort of your own home.<br><br>
I have been a massage therapist for about 12 years working in different Hotels Spa around the world like the Ritz Health Club in Paris, The Royal Monceau in Paris, The St Regis Bora Bora in french Polynesia, the Bali Hai in Australia and others places like Sicily, Italy, Switzerland..
If you would like to take a little pamper breack for yourself or even offering it as a present for your loved one, don't hesitate to contact me for more details. <br><br>
£25 for 30min <br>
£45 for 1hour<br>
£65 for 1h30</p>
