## About Me

Hello I am Alison, a French Yoga Instructor.  
Before being a Yoga teacher, I was a massage and beauty therapist for 12 years in different Hotels around the world. I have a passion for well being, I always wanted to make people feel better either with a beauty treatment or a massage.  
I started Yoga few years ago by myself and quickly realised that it was not only a good way to become stronger or more flexible but also that it help dealing with yourself. Very quickly I started to practice yoga every day then twice a day and I felt so good. Then it clicked, I needed to know more about it. I have decided to go to India and got my 200 hours Multi-Style Yoga Teacher certificate. When I got back to England I felt the need of sharing what I have learned and became a Yoga Teacher here in South Devon. I went back to India to get my second certificate (300hours) more specialised in Hatha Yoga and Ashtanga Yoga.  
For me the combination of Yoga and Massage Therapist works perfectly. Helping people to balance their body and their mind has become my priority. I am always trying to find different ways of releasing people from their stress and anxiety.  
Feel free to contact me if you have questions or want some information.  
Namaste
