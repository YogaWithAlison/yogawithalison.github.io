                    <p>Hello I am Alison, a French Yoga Instructor. <br/>Before being a Yoga teacher, I was a massage and beauty therapist for 12 years in different Hotels around the world. I have a passion for well being, I always wanted to make people feel better either with a beauty treatment or a massage. <br/>I started Yoga few years ago by myself and quickly realised that it was not only a good way to become stronger or more flexible but also that it help dealing with yourself. Very quickly I started to practice yoga every day then twice a day and I felt so good. Then it clicked, I needed to know more about it. I have decided to go to india and got my 200hours Multi-Style Yoga Teacher certificate. When I got back to England I felt the need of sharing what I have learned and became a Yoga Teacher here in South Devon. I went back to India to get my second certificate (300hours) more specialised in Hatha Yoga and Ashtanga Yoga. <br/>For me the combinaison of Yoga and Massage Therapist works perfectly. Helping people to balance their body and their mind has become my priority. I am always trying to find different ways of releasing people from their stress and anxiety. <br/>Feel free to contact me if you have questions or want some information. <br/>Namaste</p>
