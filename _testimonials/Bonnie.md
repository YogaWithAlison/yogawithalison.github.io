description: "I have been attending Alisons yoga classes since she started in Kingskerswell Village. I am feeling fantastic, more flexible, more energised, more de-stressed, and am progressing weekly. Alison is a great teacher. Encouraging, patient, motivational, kind, funny, passionate, lovely teacher. Can’t recommend Alison highly enough 🧘‍♂️🧘‍♂️"
