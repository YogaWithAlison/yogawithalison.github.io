description: I have been training with Alison for a couple of years now. And I can honestly say that it has changed my life.What started off as a way to get more flexible and gain balance and core strength to help with my Martial Art training has now become my passion. My old hamstring injury and lower back pain is gone. I feel stronger, more flexible and walk taller. I have tried Yoga before but not really 'got it'. Alison's teaching is individually focused at your level and she encourages you to reach your potential. I would recommend Yoga with Alison to anyone of any ability and fitness. Namaste
