"I have been attending Alisons classes for about 9 months. I love her teaching method, her instruction is clear and she also demonstrates the moves.  She is very aware of anyone who has difficulties and helps them to achieve what they may think is not possible whilst  allowing you to go at your own pace and not over do it. Her kind nature shines through and she has a great sense of humour, which creates a lovely atmosphere. Yoga really makes you feel good and is helpful for many ailments. I can highly recommend Alisons classes to anyone wanting to do Yoga."
